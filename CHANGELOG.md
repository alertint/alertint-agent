## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Loki log-enrichment connector** — optional read-only Loki/Grafana-Cloud-Logs client.
  At triage time it enriches the LLM prompt with the most relevant recent log lines
  (error-biased filtered query, with one unfiltered fallback), translating the incident's
  shared alert labels into LogQL via a configurable `label_map`. The exact lines the model
  saw are persisted with the finding and replayed by `alertint_get_evidence_pack`.
- **`loki_query_range` MCP tool** — read-only native-LogQL range query, registered when the
  Loki connector is enabled, so an investigating agent can drill into logs over MCP.
- **Demo log stack** — bundled Loki service in the Docker Compose dev stack plus
  `docker/push-synthetic-logs.py` (`task logs:push:local` / `task logs:push:cloud`) to seed
  fake multi-level log lines for local Loki or Grafana Cloud.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Alertmanager webhook receiver** — `POST /webhook/alertmanager` accepts Alertmanager v4
  payloads with bearer-token auth; deduplicates alerts by fingerprint into SQLite.
- **Fixed-window correlator** — groups alerts by configurable labels within a time window;
  dispatches incidents when the window expires.
- **Acute-triage skill** — builds an evidence pack (shared labels, timeline, severity
  distribution, top annotations) and calls the Anthropic Claude API to produce a
  structured finding (summary, root cause, confidence, per-alert roles).
- **Notifiers** — stdout (JSON), human-readable console, and optional Slack delivery via the
  bot-token API (`chat.postMessage`) with in-thread resolution updates.
  Resolution events are also forwarded through all configured notifiers.
- **MCP HTTP server** — `alertint serve` exposes `:9912/mcp` when `mcp.enabled: true`.
  Five read-only tools: `alertint_list_incidents`, `alertint_get_incident`,
  `alertint_search_alerts`, `alertint_get_evidence_pack`, `alertint_verify_audit`.
  Compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.
- **Prometheus read connector** — optional read-only PromQL client; powers two MCP tools
  (`prometheus_query`, `prometheus_query_range`) for live metric context during investigation.
  Also enriches the LLM prompt with relevant metric values at triage time.
- **Hash-chained audit log** — every action (alert received, LLM call, notification sent)
  appends a SHA-256-chained row. `alertint verify-audit` detects any tampering.
- **Health endpoint** — `GET /health` on the webhook port returns `{"status":"ok"}` when
  SQLite is reachable; used as the Docker healthcheck.
- **`alertint health` subcommand** — probes `GET /health` and exits 0/1; safe to use as a
  Docker `CMD` healthcheck on scratch-based images with no shell.
- **MCP client examples** — copy-paste configs for Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf under
  `examples/mcp-clients/`.
- **Docker Compose dev stack** — Alertmanager + AlertINT agent + Prometheus + Pushgateway;
  synthetic metric script for local testing.
- **Single static binary** — pure-Go SQLite (no CGO), no external runtime dependencies.
  Multi-platform builds: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/arm64`.
